# Predicting-House-Sale-Prices
Using Linear Regression to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa, USA

## Getting Started
This repository contains a jupyter notebook of the code to execute this project as well as a jpeg image of the results and xls and csv versions of the input data. The xls version of the input data was downloaded here and saved as csv for use in jupyter notebook.

## Project Information
This guided project was completed at the end of a [Linear Regression for Machine Learning](https://www.dataquest.io/course/linear-regression-for-machine-learning/) course during the [Data Scientist in Python](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/) path on Dataquest.io. 

The idea of experimenting with data cleaning operations before implementing them into an ML model was suggested during the course notes, but most of the development of the opeations used is my own work. The need to handle different values of k for the linear regression model was also highlighted in the course notes. The procedure to do so and the output of the code is also my own work.
